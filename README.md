# Assembly-Evaluation-Tools
<p align="justify">
In order to repliacte the assembly evaluation results presented in our paper " A roadmap to sequence assembly evaluation tools ", we created this repository.</p> 

## Data set
We used a real benchmark dataset (S. aureus, genome size= 2903081bp) from [GAGE website](http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/data/index.html). There are two sequencing libraries for this data set, one is fragmented with average read length 101bp and the other is short jump with average read length 37bp. We extracted the [Contigs/Scaffolds](http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu/results/index.html) produced from the Velvet assembler and ran the assembly evaluation tools Assemblathon, GAGE, QUAST, and CGAL.
